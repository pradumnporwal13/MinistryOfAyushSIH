        <h2>About</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We will develop a device called the 'Tongumeter' which will be connected to a website, 'Tongucometer.' This device will approximate the taste of Sweet (Madhura), Sour (Amla), and Bitter (Tikta) from among the five primary Ayurvedic rasas. For Madhura rasa, we will use the MQ3 Sensor, for Amla rasa, the MQ4 Sensor, and for Tikta rasa, the MQ5 Sensor. Each sensor will be calibrated for its respective rasa.

            Additionally, to enhance accuracy, we will use pH analog sensors for Madhura and Amla rasas.
            
            The calibrated data will be combined into a kit. Users can check the quantitative analysis of any herb through the device. The results will be stored on the website automatically.
            
            For health applications, a user-friendly website interface will allow users to search for quantitative analyses of herbs. If the data is not available, users can perform their own analyses using the Tongumeter device and publicly share their findings.
            
            In parallel, we will develop a chatbot that will guide patients based on their health concerns. It will recommend which rasas and herbs are suitable for them, considering their individual profiles. This chatbot will cross-reference the quantitative analysis data from the website to ensure that the recommended herbs contain the desired rasas.
            
            This comprehensive system will empower patients to make informed decisions about Ayurvedic remedies. It will also ensure data privacy and security, compliance with medical ethics and regulations, and continuous learning to improve recommendations based on user feedback and outcomes.</p>
